                <p class="proj-desc">This web application is developed by using HTML, CSS and
                    JavaScript. WebCodeCrypt is a convenient tool that transforms
                    any URL or plain text input into a Quick Response (QR) code. This
                    allows users for quick and efficient sharing of information, as
                    individuals can scan the QR code with a compatible device,
                    instantly accessing the encoded content, such as websites, contact
                    details, or important messages. It's a practical solution for
                    enhancing accessibility and engagement in various personal and
                    business contexts.</p>

                <h3>Employee Payroll Management System</h3>
                <p class="proj-desc">This application is developed by using Java and OOPS principles
                    like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It allows the
                    admin to manage employee information, calculate salaries, and
                    generate payroll reports. Here in this admin access verification is
                    also added in this application.</p>

                <h3>Image Crypto Application</h3>
                <p class="proj-desc">This Java application is developed for performing encryption and
                    decryption of an image file using a simple XOR operation. The
                    program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing
                    components to allow the user to select an image file and enter a
                    key value for encryption/decryption. The program then reads the
                    image file into a byte array, applies the XOR operation with the
                    given key, and writes the modified byte array back to the same
                    file.</p>

                    Bootstrap and MySQL where we can perform CRUD operations.
                    Here a person who want to get register can get registered by
                    providing the asked credentials and these changes can be
                    reflected in the database which we created.</p>
